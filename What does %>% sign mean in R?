This weird looking sign is a forward-pipe operator.

You can use it to pass the left-hand side input through the right-hand side operator. In mathematical terms, it is the following operation:

x%>%f which translates to f(x)

Here is a simple example, where I create a vector of values, take the root square of every number and then compute the sum:

c(1,2,3,4) %>% Map(sqrt, .) %>%  Reduce(sum, .)
# The output: [1] 6.146264


It is very useful when you need to apply many different transformations to your data and donâ€™t want to save the intermediate results or have many opening and closing function parentheses.

Consider writing the following:

x %>% impute %>% shuffle %>% pivot
versus the alternative:

pivot(shuffle(impute(x)))


You can use it in your R session by loading the margrittr[1] package:

library(magrittr)
